# EasyCommerce

This project will be a study case of a microservice application. I intend to use:

- Node
- Deno
- Docker
- Kubernetes 
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Redis
- MongoDb
- PostgreSQL
- RabbitMQ
- GraphQL
- gRPC
- EventSourcing
- CQRS
- Clean Architecture

The project is inspired from [coolstore project](https://github.com/vietnam-devs/coolstore-microservices)
